## Introduction
The New York News is an application that displays top stories sourced from the New York Times API. The user can select a specific category to view articles from and then click to a more detailed view of article info. This was initially created as a take home challenge simulation completed in around 8 hours.

## Learning Goals
Use the New York Times Top Stories API to prioritize time and features to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that showcases a strong understanding of React and Front-End principles and meets the specifications of the user stories below:
1. A list of articles
2. A ‚Äúdetailed‚Äù view for each article (as opposed to summary/list view)
3. Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view you create
4. Some sort of search, filter, OR sort

## Features
When the avid news reader visits the homepage of The New York News app, the user is greeted with a list of top stories from the home page of New York Times. Then the user can select a new category to view its corresponding articles using the nav bar. Then click on an individual article to link to a more detailed view of the article. 

## Setup
1. Fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button. 
2. Clone down the forked repo. To rename your project you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the page running in your browser on `http://localhost:3000/`. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. 
7. Enjoy!

## Future Additions
- Add Cypress E2E testing view all user views to ensure a smooth user experience. 
- Add media queries for responsiveness across all devices. 
- Add additional images/styling for "loading" and other error handling to help assist the user.

## Technologies
